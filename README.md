# Android-test-repo

This project is used to create simple sample of the differents types of test that can be used in Android development.

Types of test :
- Unit tests : Test your functions or your conditions
- Component test : Test parts of your app with mocked data
- Integration test : Same as component test with real data (API, Database, ...)
- E2E test (End-to-End test) : Test one or more process in your app (login, registration, ...)
- TNR (Test Non Regression) : With unit test you test new features and with TNR you test if the code that wasn't modified still works.
- UI Test : Check if the app have a the wanted behaviour
